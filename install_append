# Default perms are 555, but this causes `brp-strip` to fail: it requires write
# access to the files. With rpm < 4.17 on Clear Linux, the files were not
# processed; `brp-strip-shared` was responsible for processing these files, but
# that script was disabled.  With rpm 4.17, `brp-strip` handles processing of
# most ELF content (except debuginfo and kernel modules).
